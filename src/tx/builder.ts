/**
 * Fluent transaction builder for batching multiple operations into a single transaction.
 *
 * Instead of executing each operation separately, `TxBuilder` collects contract calls
 * and submits them all at once via `wallet.execute()`. This saves gas and ensures
 * atomicity — either every operation succeeds or none of them do.
 *
 * Create a builder via `wallet.tx()`, chain operations, then call `.send()`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Approve + stake in one transaction
 * const tx = await wallet.tx()
 *   .enterPool(poolAddress, Amount.parse("100", STRK))
 *   .send();
 * await tx.wait();
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Transfer multiple tokens + claim rewards atomically
 * const tx = await wallet.tx()
 *   .transfer(USDC, [
 *     { to: alice, amount: Amount.parse("50", USDC) },
 *     { to: bob, amount: Amount.parse("25", USDC) },
 *   ])
 *   .claimPoolRewards(poolAddress)
 *   .send();
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Mix high-level helpers with raw calls
 * const tx = await wallet.tx()
 *   .approve(STRK, dexAddress, amount)
 *   .add({ contractAddress: dexAddress, entrypoint: "swap", calldata: [...] })
 *   .transfer(USDC, { to: alice, amount: usdcAmount })
 *   .send();
 * ```
